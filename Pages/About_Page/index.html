                    Assassin's Creed is an open-world, action-adventure, and stealth game franchise published by Ubisoft
                    and developed mainly by its studio Ubisoft Montreal using the game engine Anvil and its more
                    advanced derivatives. Created by Patrice Désilets, Jade Raymond, and Corey May, the Assassin's Creed
                    video game series depicts a fictional millennia-old struggle between the Order of Assassins, who
                    fight for peace and free will, and the Knights Templar, who desire peace through order and control.
                    The series features historical fiction, science fiction, and fictional characters intertwined with
                    real-world historical events and historical figures. In most games, players control a historical
                    Assassin while also playing as an Assassin Initiate or someone caught in the Assassin–Templar
                    conflict in the present-day framing story. Considered a spiritual successor to the Prince of Persia
                    series, Assassin's Creed took inspiration from the novel Alamut by the Slovenian writer Vladimir
                    Bartol, based on the historical Hashashin sect of the medieval Middle East.

                    The first Assassin's Creed was released in 2007, and it has featured twelve main games in total, the
                    most recent being Assassin's Creed Valhalla in 2020. Main games in the Assassin's Creed series are
                    set in an open world and played from the third-person view. Gameplay revolves around combat,
                    stealth, and exploration, including the use of parkour to navigate the environment. The games
                    feature both main and side missions, and some titles also include competitive and cooperative
                    multiplayer game modes.

                    A new story and occasionally new time periods are introduced in each entry, with the gameplay
                    elements also evolving. There are three overarching story arcs in the series. The first five main
                    games follow Desmond Miles, a descendant of several important Assassins throughout history, who uses
                    a machine called the Animus to relive his ancestors' memories and find powerful artifacts called
                    Pieces of Eden while also attempting to prevent a catastrophic event, referencing the 2012
                    phenomenon, said to wipe out humanity by the end of 2012. From Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag to
                    Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Assassin initiates and employees of Abstergo (a company used as a front
                    by the modern-day Templars) record genetic memories using the Helix software, helping the Templars
                    and Assassins find new Pieces of Eden in the modern world. The most recent games, Assassin's Creed
                    Origins, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and Valhalla, follow ex-Abstergo employee Layla Hassan on her own
                    quest to save humanity from another disaster.

                    The main games in the Assassin's Creed franchise have received generally positive reviews for their
                    ambition in visuals, game design, and narratives, with criticism for the yearly release cycle and
                    frequent bugs, as well as the prioritising of role-playing mechanics in later titles. The series has
                    received multiple awards and nominations, including multiple Game of the Year awards. It is
                    commercially successful, selling over 200 million copies as of September 2022, becoming Ubisoft's
                    best-selling franchise and one of the highest selling video game franchises of all time. While main
                    titles are produced for major consoles and desktop platforms, multiple spin-off games have been
                    released for consoles, mobiles, and handheld platforms. A series of art books, encyclopedias,
                    comics, novelizations, and novels have also been published. A live-action film adaptation of the
                    series, titled Assassin's Creed, was released in 2016.
